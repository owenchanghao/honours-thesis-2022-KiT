# Keep Elders in Touch under Covid-19: Analysing WeChat's Usability for Chinese Elders

Welcome to Changhao Li's honours thesis project on GitHub! As an honours student at the University of Sydney, I spent the entire 2022 preparing for the "Keep-in-Touch" (KiT) thesis alongside my normal studying and internship schedule. It was a busy but fruitful year!

All relevant materials are documented in this GitHub Repository. Feel free to examine them and provide feedbacks!

## Abstract
During the Covid-19 (or formally, SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that started in late 2019, governments around the globe constantly deployed local, neighborhood-wide lockdown or self-isolation measures to prevent the spread of the virus. One of the consequences is that elders might be forced into situations where they have to live separately from their children during the lockdown or self-isolation period. During this period, elders' daily activities might be seriously affected, including the loss of face-to-face chat opportunities with family and friends. This means that elders are pushed to live online and adapt to the use of social media. Therefore, a well-designed application with good usability design and HCI experience would be valuable to the elders.

In China, WeChat is one of the most widely used apps for contacting others. As an app with communication, payment, location, and many other services, WeChat has features that promote an online communication way of life. Can WeChat also promote elder-friendly design and function? What problems do elders often encounter when they are using WeChat? This thesis starts with a preliminary survey and need-finding user studies, and then moves into interface analysis using both HCI and statistical methods and further build user models via classification methods.

This thesis is part of the broader ``keep elders in touch'' project and it aims to investigate the characteristics of Chinese elders' behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic, including the difficulties they encountered when they are using modern technologies as well as a detailed WeChat interface analysis. This paper contributes in following aspects: a) examine the current keep-in-touch situation of Chinese elders during Covid-19; b) synthesize previous research on relevant academic projects; c) analyze the WeChat user interface in detail and construct the links to past projects; and d) collect data on WeChat using HCI methods, including questionnaire, think aloud and heuristic evaluation, thus highlight usability issues of WeChat. The above contributions could improve Chinese elders' experience during lockdowns or self-isolation periods, and potentially benefit elders more broadly in areas like the promotion of well-being and the prevention of serious psychological illness.
